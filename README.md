# Redux Essentials Tutorial Example

This project contains the setup and code from the "Redux Essentials" tutorial in the Redux docs ( https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts ).

The `master` branch has a single commit that already has the initial project configuration in place. You can use this to follow along with the instructions from the tutorial.

The `tutorial-steps` branch has the actual code commits from the tutorial. You can look at these to see how the official tutorial actually implements each piece of functionality along the way.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

> **Note**: If you are using Node 17, this project may not start correctly due to a known issue with Webpack and Node's OpenSSL changes, which causes an error message containing `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED`.  
> You can work around this by setting a `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` environment variable before starting the dev server.

Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
